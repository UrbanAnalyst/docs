# Example

This chapter demonstrates most of the capabilities of the [Urban Analyst
platform](https://urbananalyst.city) by way of an example analysis comparing
the cities of Paris, France, and Berlin, Germany.

## Stats page

The "Stats" page compares all current UTA cities in terms of a range of
statistics. Most statistics can be viewed as both "Average" or "Variation"
values. "Average" means the direct value averaged across a whole city, while
"Variation" measures the extend to which the chosen variable varies across a
city. This section will briefly describe what each of the variables, and in
each of these two forms, reveal about differences between Paris and Berlin.
It is important to remember throughout that lower values in all UTA statistics
are always better.

### Transport Absolute

This variable measures the absolute time (in minutes) required to travel a
distance of 10km from each point in a city, using any combination of travel
modes except private automobile (including walking, bicycling, and any
available public transport options). The "Average" values show that travelling
10km in Paris takes just under 40 minutes on average, while equivalent journeys
in Berlin require a bit over one minute more. The equivalent "Variation" values
also show that absolute travel times in Paris are more consistent, generally
varying across the city by about 1.7 minutes around the 40 minute average time,
while travel times in Berlin vary by over 1.8 minutes around the 41 minute
average time.

This layer thus reveals that Paris has a faster and more consistent transport
system than Berlin.

### Transport Relative

The relative transport values divide the absolute travel times described above
by times for equivalent journeys with private automobile. Ratios of one imply
automobile times equal to multi-modal times; ratios of less than one imply that
multi-modal transport is faster than private automobile. Paris and Berlin both
have comparably low values for this ratio, imply relatively fast multi-modal
transport, with Paris slightly faster than Berlin, as observed with absolute
transport times.

The "Variation" values are nevertheless reversed compared with
equivalent absolute transport values, with Berlin having lower variation than
Paris. A comparison of these statistics on the "Maps" page reveals that this is
largely because Paris is simply much larger than Berlin, and the range of
relative transport values correspondingly greater, ranging between around 0.6
and 1.6, while values in Berlin only range between around 1 and 1.25.

The fact that relative transport in Paris is still better on average than in
Berlin is thus even more impressive considering this stark difference in scale.
