# Overview

This chapter provides an overview of the three main pages of the [Urban Analyst
platform](https://urbananalyst.city):

- [Maps](https://urbananalyst.city/maps) showing interactive maps for each
  city;
- [Stats](https://urbananalyst.city/stats) comparing aggregate statistics for
  all cities; and
- [Transformations](https://urbananalyst.city/transform) for transforming any
  chosen city to become more like other cities.

## Maps

The [Maps page](https://urbananalyst.city/maps) is the first and main page of
Urban Analyst. This page shows interactive maps for each city, with values for
all UA variables displayed in small polygons. These polygons are defined by
city-specific assessments of spatial disadvantage. Berlin, for example,
regularly measures a compound index of social disadvantage aggregated into XX
polygons. The map for Berlin uses these polygons provided by the city to
aggregate all measured variables. The variables are described in a [subsequent
chapter](./variables.md).

As in all UA measurements, lower values of all variables are generally better
than higher values. Colour scales on all maps thus generally display lower
values in brighter, yellow colours, while higher values are displayed in
darker, blue or violet colours. The control panel includes an "Explain Layer"
button which opens a text panel explaining details of the chosen variable.

### Single and Paired Variables

The control panel of the [maps page](https://urbananalyst.city/maps) enables
each variable to be selected, with the map being updated on each selection to
display the spatial distribution of the chosen variable. The control panel also
includes an option to select "paired" variables. The resultant maps then
display the strength of relationship between any chosen *pair* of variables.

For example, choosing social index and the nature index will
display the strength of relationship between access to natural spaces and
social disadvantage. Both of these variables are measured such that low values
are better than high values. A positive relationship between the two would then
mean that lower social disadantage is coupled with better access to natural
spaces, while high social disadvantage is coupled with worse access to natural
spaces. Conversely, a negative relationship would indicate that higher social
disadantage was coupled with better access to natural resources. Or, in the
words brought up by clicking the "Explain Layer" button, "Low values indicate
that good access to natural spaces is coupled with disadvantageous social
conditions."
