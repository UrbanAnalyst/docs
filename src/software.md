# Software and Algorithms

## Software

The primary software used to generate the results presented on [Urban Analyst](https://urbananalyst.city) are:

- [`osmdata`](https://docs.ropensci.org/osmdata) for accessing and processing
  data from Open Street Map.

- [`dodgr`](https://UrbanAnalyst.github.io/dodgr) for general network routing queries.

- [`gtfsrouter`](https://UrbanAnalyst.github.io/gtfsrouter) for public transport routine queries.

- [`m4ra`](https://UrbanAnalyst.github.io/m4ra) for multi-modal routing queries

- [`ua-engine`](https://github.com/UrbanAnalyst/ua-engine) for additional
  algorithms combining aspects of these other routing algorithms for tasks
  specific to Urban Analyst.

All of this software was primarily developed by the same team responsible for
Urban Analyst itself.
