# Introduction

Documentation for [Urban Analyst platform](https://urbananalyst.city),
providing open source analyses of urban transport systems across the world.

Urban Transport Analyst provides interactive maps of the properties of urban
transport systems, and relationships of these properties to socio-demographic
conditions.  UTA also provides statistical summaries of all cities, including
representation in the "UTA Index", which captures the extent to which transport
systems effectively counter-balance socio-demographic disadvantage.
