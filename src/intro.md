# Introduction

This is the documentation for [Urban Analyst platform
(UA)](https://urbananalyst.city), providing open source analyses of urban
structure and function across the world.

Urban Analyst provides interactive maps of the properties of cities, including
socio-demographic conditions and the structure and function of transport
systems. Each property is measured in terms of a "variable". Relationships
between individual variables are also analysed and presented, such as between
socio-demographic conditions and frequency of transport services, or between
distances to nearest schools and access to natural spaces.

UA also provides statistical summaries of all cities, enabling relationships
between any pair of variables, such as transport and socio-demographic
disadvantage, to be compared across all UA cities.

## Structure

This documentation includes the following four chapters:

1. This introduction
2. ["Example"](./example.md): A walk-through example comparison between Berlin, Germany and Paris, France, illustrating the kinds of comparisons enabled by the Urban Analyst platform.
3. ["UTA Variables"](./variables.md): Providing descriptions of all variables included in the Urban Analyst platform.
4. ["Data Sources"](./data.md): Providing descriptions of all data sources used to derive these variables.
5. ["Software and Algorithms"](./software.md): Providing descriptions of, and links to, all software used to generate the UTA variables.
