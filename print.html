<p>This is the documentation for <a href="https://urbananalyst.city">Urban Analyst (UA)</a>.
Urban Analyst analyses the structure and function of cities across the world.
Each city can be viewed as an <a href="https://urbananalyst.city/maps">interactive map</a>
displaying several different properties or variables. These include
socio-demographic conditions and the structure and function of transport
systems. The platform also analyses relationships between individual variables,
such as between socio-demographic conditions and frequency of transport
services, or between distances to nearest schools and access to natural spaces.</p>
<p>UA also provides <a href="https://urbananalyst.city/compare">statistical comparisons</a>
between all cities, enabling comparisons across all UA cities of single
variables, as well as relationships between any pair of variables, such as
transport and socio-demographic disadvantage.</p>
<p>Finally, UA enables cities to "learn" from one another, by visualising how the
properties of any chosen city can best be transformed to become more like the
properties of any other chosen city. Paris, for example, has better bicycle
infrastructure than Berlin, and the UA transformation algorithm can calculate
how Berlin can most easily transform its bicycle infrastructure to become more
like Paris. Values for every area in Berlin are then displayed as the
proportional increase in bicycle infrastructure which would be necessary for
the whole city to have infrastructure equivalent to Paris.</p>
<h1 id="how-does-it-work"><a class="header" href="#how-does-it-work">How does it work?</a></h1>
<p>Urban Analyst present a variety of <a href="./variables.html">variables</a> for each city
analysed, as well as relationships between these variables. Values for each
variable are derived at every street intersection in each city. These values
are then aggregated into the polygons shown in the <a href="https://urbananalyst.city/maps">"Map"
page</a> and
<a href="https://urbananalyst.city/transform">"Transform"</a> pages, and across entire
cities for the values shown in the
<a href="https://urbananalyst.city/compare">"Compare"</a> page. Aggregations are always
weighted by local population densities, so that all UA values represent values
<em>per person</em> as experienced in each city. Details are provided in the <a href="./data.html"><em>Data
Sources</em></a> and <a href="./software.html"><em>Software and Algorithms</em></a> chapters.</p>
<h1 id="how-many-calculations-are-involved"><a class="header" href="#how-many-calculations-are-involved">How many calculations are involved?</a></h1>
<p>The values presented in Urban Analyst are derived from estimates of travel
times from every point in each city to every other point using any combination
of possible modes of transport. The following table summarises numbers of
street intersections, public transport ("PT") stops, and calculations for a
selection of Urban Analyst cities.</p>
<div class="table-wrapper"><table><thead><tr><th>city</th><th>intersections<br>(thousands)</th><th>PT stops</th><th>PT calcs<br>(millions)</th><th>routing calcs<br>(billions)</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>Berlin</td><td>360</td><td>9,302</td><td>173</td><td>150</td></tr>
<tr><td>Hamburg</td><td>192</td><td>4,585</td><td>42</td><td>56</td></tr>
<tr><td>London</td><td>506</td><td>20,072</td><td>806</td><td>160</td></tr>
<tr><td>Paris</td><td>313</td><td>29,393</td><td>1,728</td><td>124</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
</div>
<p>One way to appreciate the scale of these calculations is through comparison
with commercial alternatives. One service, <em>traveltime.com</em>, charges a flat
subscription fee of €540 per month for a maximum of 60 requests per minute.
That rate would permit 31.5 million queries per year. The city of Hamburg, for
example, would then take almost 2,000 years to calculate, and would cost
€12 million. Google also offers a commercial routing service, limited to a
maximum of 500,000 queries per month, for a total price of US$2,000. At that
rate, the analyses for Hamburg would cost US$224 million.</p>
<p>The results presented in Urban Analyst are simply not possible using commercial
tools, or indeed any other open source tools. These analyses truly are uniquely
powerful, and provide a depth of insight into how people move through cities
not available in any other way.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="overview"><a class="header" href="#overview">Overview</a></h1>
<p>This chapter provides an overview of the four main pages of the <a href="https://urbananalyst.city">Urban Analyst
platform</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://urbananalyst.city/summarise">summarise page</a> provides summary
overviews for each city of key statistical properties and relationships with
other cities;</li>
<li>The <a href="https://urbananalyst.city/compare">compare page</a> compares aggregate
statistics for all cities;</li>
<li>The <a href="https://urbananalyst.city/maps">map page</a> shows interactive maps for
each city;</li>
<li>The <a href="https://urbananalyst.city/transform">transform page</a> shows the effect of
transforming any chosen city to become more like other cities.</li>
</ul>
<p>The best place to start is the <a href="https://urbananalyst.city/summarise">Summarise
page</a>. The summary for any chosen city
will indicate which properties of the other pages are most important. Each of
the latter three pages also includes a pop-up "guided tour" explaining the key
features. These tours will automatically start the first time a page is opened,
or can be manually opened by clicking on the "Help" button on any of the main
pages.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="summarise"><a class="header" href="#summarise">Summarise</a></h2>
<p>The <a href="https://urbananalyst.city/summarise">Summarise page</a> provides an overview
of the general statistical properties of any chosen UA city. Statistics for
each chosen city are compared with those for all other cities, and textual
summaries generated for all statistics which are significantly different.
Summaries are provided not just for individual statistics, but for the
strengths of relationship between all pairs of statistics.</p>
<p>The values described in this initial part of the <a href="https://urbananalyst.city/summarise">Summarise
page</a> indicate which statistics might be
particularly worth examining in both the
<a href="https://urbananalyst.city/compare">Compare</a> and the <a href="https://urbananalyst.city/map">Map
</a> pages.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://urbananalyst.city/summarise">Summarise page</a> also includes a
section describing the best "Target city" for each chosen city. As explained
there, the best target city is the city which is best in all the ways that the
chosen city is worse than average. This target city, and corresponding
variables described there, indicate which cities and variables might be
particularly worth examining in the <a href="https://urbananalyst.city/transform">Transform
page</a>.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="compare"><a class="header" href="#compare">Compare</a></h2>
<p>The <a href="https://urbananalyst.city/compare">Compare page</a> enables comparisons
between all UA cities, both in terms of single variables and relationships
between any selected pair of variables. A pull-down panel enables each variable
or "layer" to be selected. The page then displays a graphical representation of
values of the chosen layer for all cities. As in all UA pages, lower values are
generally better than higher values. The control panel includes an "Explain
Layer" button which opens a text panel explaining details of the chosen
variable.</p>
<h3 id="single-and-paired-variables"><a class="header" href="#single-and-paired-variables">Single and Paired Variables</a></h3>
<p>The control panel of the <a href="https://urbananalyst.city/compare">compare page</a>
includes an option to select "paired" variables. The resultant graphs then
display the strength of relationship between any chosen <em>pair</em> of variables.
For example, choosing social index and the nature index will display the
strength of relationship between access to natural spaces and social
disadvantage. Both of these variables are measured such that low values are
better than high values. A positive relationship between the two would then
mean that lower social disadvantage is coupled with better access to natural
spaces, while high social disadvantage is coupled with worse access to natural
spaces. Conversely, a negative relationship would indicate that higher social
disadvantage was coupled with better access to natural resources. Or, in the
words brought up by clicking the "Explain Layer" button, "Low values indicate
that good access to natural spaces is coupled with disadvantageous social
conditions."</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="map"><a class="header" href="#map">Map</a></h2>
<p>The <a href="https://urbananalyst.city/map">Map page</a> shows interactive maps for each
city, with values for all UA variables displayed in small polygons. These
polygons are defined by city-specific assessments of spatial disadvantage.
Berlin, for example, regularly measures a compound index of social disadvantage
aggregated into XX polygons. The map for Berlin uses these polygons provided by
the city to aggregate all measured variables. The variables are described in a
<a href="./variables.html">subsequent chapter</a>.</p>
<p>Details of the polygons for each city can be seen by selecting the "Social"
layer in the Map page and then clicking on the "Explain Layer" button.</p>
<p>As in all UA measurements, lower values of all variables are generally better
than higher values. Colour scales on all maps thus generally display lower
values in brighter, yellow colours, while higher values are displayed in
darker, blue or violet colours. The control panel includes an "Explain Layer"
button which opens a text panel explaining details of the chosen variable.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="transform"><a class="header" href="#transform">Transform</a></h2>
<p>The <a href="https://urbananalyst.city/transform">Transform page</a> enables the
properties of any chosen city to be transformed to reflect equivalent
properties of some chosen "target" city. This page is best explained by an
example. Looking at the <a href="https://urbananalyst.city/compare">Compare page</a> for
the "bike index" shows that Berlin has relatively poor bicycle infrastructure,
while Paris is a very good city for cyclists. The
<a href="https://urbananalyst.city/transform">Transform page</a> can be used to visualise
how Berlin could best transform its current bicycle infrastructure to have an
overall distribution across the whole city equivalent to Paris. Conversely,
Paris has poorer access to natural spaces than Berlin, and the page could also
be used to examine how Paris could best transform its access to natural spaces
so that it functioned more like Berlin.</p>
<p>Urban Analyst values displayed in the <a href="https://urbananalyst.city/map">Map page</a>
are aggregated from generally hundreds of thousands of individual calculations
at every street junction in each city. For the chosen variable, subsets of
these individual data points are sampled from each city, and the statistical
distribution for the chosen city is then transformed by changing each point by
the smallest amount possible so that they reflect the distribution in the
target city. These values are then aggregated into the polygons defined for the
city, to produce a visual representation of the least-cost transformation that
would be necessary for the city to have the same distribution as that of the
target city. The transformation algorithm is described in detail in the final
<a href="./software.html"><em>Software and Algorithms</em> chapter</a>.</p>
<h3 id="extra-layers"><a class="header" href="#extra-layers">Extra Layers</a></h3>
<p>The <a href="https://urbananalyst.city/transform">Transform page</a> includes an
additional button labelled <em>Extra Layers</em>. The transformations described above
described transforming single layers or variables. The <em>Extra Layers</em> panel
enables transformations not just of single chosen variables, but also of their
relationships with other variables. Examining the <a href="https://urbananalyst.city/compare">Compare
page</a>, for example, shows that not only does
Paris provide poorer access to natural spaces than Berlin, but also that Berlin
has a better relationship between access to natural spaces and social
disadvantage. (This can be seen by clicking on the "<em>Paired</em>" layer option and
selecting those two layers.) The <em>Extra Layers</em> panel can be used in this case
to examine not just how Paris might best transform its access to nature to look
more like Berlin, but also how it might also improve its relationship between
access to nature and social disadvantage.</p>
<p>By default, values of <em>Extra Layers</em> are automatically selected as those which
have better relationships in the chosen target city. These default values will
thus change for each choice of target city and focal layer. It may be necessary
to click on the "Reset" button in the <em>Extra Layers</em> panel to update this
default selection after changing any of these options.</p>
<h3 id="output-layer"><a class="header" href="#output-layer">Output Layer</a></h3>
<p>Finally, the <a href="https://urbananalyst.city/transform">Transform page</a> also has an
<em>Output Layer</em> option at the bottom of the control panel. This enables results
of the transformation algorithm to be displayed in one of four ways:</p>
<ol>
<li><em>Original</em> to show original values, prior to transformation;</li>
<li><em>Transformed</em> to show the actual transformed values;</li>
<li><em>Absolute</em> to show the absolute value by which each are in the city would

<p>This chapter demonstrates most of the capabilities of the <a href="https://urbananalyst.city">Urban Analyst
platform</a> through exploring comparisons between the
cities of Paris, France, and Berlin, Germany. It is important to remember
throughout that lower values in all UA statistics are always better. Values
are also weighted by local population densities. This is important because, for
example, public transport systems should be constructed to offer the fastest
services to the areas where most people live. Not implementing this weighting
would, in contrast, leave measures in some form of times per unit area, so that
for example travel times from unpopulated parts of a city would be weighted
equally to times from densely populated parts. Weighting travel times, and all
other UA variables, by population density converts them to values as
experienced on average by each person in a city.</p>
<p>The comparisons in this chapter between Paris and Berlin are mostly drawn from
the "Stats" page, which provides overviews of entire cities, and comparisons
with all other UA cities. The "Maps" page can then be used to examine the
actual spatial distributions of particular variables or relationships within
any given city.</p>
<p>This comparison starts by stepping through each variable to describe kinds of
information able to be extracted, before examining pairwise relationships
between these variables, and concluding with a general summary. The <a href="https://urbananalyst.city">Urban
Analyst platform</a> currently measures 11 variables,
along with strengths of relationship between all paired combinations of these.
This amounts to 11 * (11 - 1) / 2 = 55 pairwise combinations. Strengths of
relationship are standardised, so are comparable throughout between all pairs
of variables, and between different cities. Two additional variables are
included for cities from the USA, enabling even more pairwise comparisons for
these cities.</p>
<h2 id="individual-variables"><a class="header" href="#individual-variables">Individual Variables.</a></h2>
<p>The following table summarises the values of the individual variables for each
city (each measured on its own distinct scale).</p>

<p>Social disadvantage is also quantified for all cities. However, each city
calculates this in different ways, and values are not comparable between
cities. Values are nevertheless standardised for the pairwise comparisons, and
strengths of relationship described there remain valid.</p>
<h3 id="transport"><a class="header" href="#transport">Transport</a></h3>
<p>The "Transport Absolute" variable measures the absolute time (in minutes)
required to travel a distance of 10km from each point in a city, using any
combination of travel modes except private automobile, including walking,
bicycling, and any available public transport options. Travelling 10km in
Paris takes under 40 minutes on average, while equivalent journeys in
Berlin require almost 1.5 minutes more.</p>
<p>The "Transport Relative" values divide the absolute travel times described above
by times for equivalent journeys with private automobile. Ratios of one imply
automobile times equal to multi-modal times; ratios of less than one imply that
multi-modal transport is faster than private automobile. Paris and Berlin both
have comparably low values for this ratio, implying relatively fast multi-modal
transport, with Paris notably faster than Berlin. This is likely influenced by
Paris's recent introduction of a uniform maximum speed limits of 30km/hour
through the city, whereas Berlin features a number of "autobahns" with much
higher speed limits.</p>
<p>Note that travel times with private automobiles include estimates of times
required to park a vehicle and ultimately walk to any desired destination.
Vehicular times calculated here are thus notably longer than with most
commercial routing engines, which give vehicular travel times only, and ignore
the critical need to park a vehicle and walk to a destination.</p>
<p>All individual variables also enable comparison in terms of "Variation", rather
than "Average" values. Comparing these reveals that Berlin generally has
markedly lower variation than Paris. A comparison of these statistics on the
"Maps" page reveals that this is largely because Paris is simply much larger
than Berlin, and the ranges of both absolute and relative transport times are
correspondingly greater. The fact that relative transport in Paris is still
better on average than in Berlin is thus even more impressive considering this
stark difference in scale.</p>
<p>Travelling in Paris requires notably greater numbers of transfers to travel
equivalent distances than Berlin. The values in the "Number of Transfers" layer
are for journeys of 10km total distance (including walking or cycling distances
at either end). Travelling in Paris requires &gt; 50% more transfers than journeys
in Berlin.</p>
<p>The fourth transport variable, "Interval", measures the time to wait (in
minutes) until the next equivalent service. Intervals in Paris are slightly
under 5 minutes, whereas values in Berlin are just under 7 minutes.</p>
<p>Finally, the "Compound Transport" variable simply multiplies absolute travel
times by intervals between services. Low values of this statistic reflect fast
and frequent transport. This statistic also indicates considerably superior
service in Paris compared with Berlin.</p>
<h3 id="other-variables"><a class="header" href="#other-variables">Other Variables</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>"School Distance": Paris has notably shorter distances from each point in the
city to the nearest school than does Berlin.</li>
<li>"Bicycle Index": Paris has very notably better bicycle infrastructure than
Berlin. This index is simply one minus the average portion of all bicycle
journeys out to 5km from each point which may be taken on dedicated bicycle
infrastructure. Around one quarter of all bicycle journeys in Paris may be
taken along dedicated bicycle ways, compared to less than one fifth in
Berlin. Moreover, comparing the maps for this variable reveal that the
bicycle infrastructure in Berlin generally improves with distance away from
the city centre, whereas Paris has the best bicycle infrastructure
concentrated towards the centre of the city.</li>
<li>"Nature Index": Access to natural spaces in the two cities is effectively the
opposite of the bicycle index. Paris provides relatively little
access to natural spaces for anybody not close to one of the two huge parks
in the city, whereas Berlin provides an abundance of generally smaller
natural spaces dispersed throughout the city. Note that natural space access
includes walks alongside water bodies. Both cities include dominant rivers,
yet Berlin also provides greater pedestrian access to the banks of its rivers
and canals. Comparison of this layer on the maps reveals the comparably
greater access in Berlin to walking paths alongside canals and rivers,
whereas most of the Seine in Paris is effectively inaccessible to
pedestrians.</li>
<li>"Parking": Finally, both Paris and Berlin offer relatively little opportunity
to park private automobiles compared with the other UA cities, with Berlin
notably less than Paris.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="relationships-between-variables"><a class="header" href="#relationships-between-variables">Relationships between variables</a></h2>
<p>This section considers relationships between each individual variable and all
other variables. All strengths of relationship shown in the "Stats" page are
assessed in standardised ways, so they may be directly compared between cities.
Moreover, the scales shown in the "Stats" page may also be directly compared.
Values of one or greater indicate very strong relationships, whereas values
less than 0.1 or so indicate weak relationships, and values less than around
0.01 should generally be interpret to indicate no relationship. Pairs of
variables with very weak or negligible strengths of relationship are generally
not interpreted in the following sub-sections.</p>

relationships for each city:</p>

</div>
<h3 id="transport-variables"><a class="header" href="#transport-variables">Transport Variables</a></h3>
<p>This sub-section only considers transport times, both in absolute and relative
sense. The other transport variables, of intervals and numbers of transfers,
generally follow similar patterns and are not explicitly considered here.
Relative transport times are only very weakly related to most other variables.
In contrast, absolute transport times are strongly related to most other
variables.</p>
<p>Relative transport times are negligibly associated with population densities,
while absolute times are particularly strongly and negatively correlated. These
negative relationships indicate that faster transport is associated with higher
population densities, more so in Berlin than Paris.</p>
<p>Slightly weaker relationships are manifest between absolute travel times and
distances to nearest schools. Relationships in both Berlin and Paris are
positive, indicating that fast public transport is positively associated with
shorter distances to schools, with the relationship about twice as strong in
Berlin as in Paris.</p>
<p>Travel times are very strongly, and positively, correlated with bicycle
infrastructure, indicating faster travel times in regions with better bicycle
infrastructure. This relationship is much stronger in Paris than in Berlin, for
reasons easy to discern by looking at the maps of Berlin for these two
variables. Bicycle infrastructure there is much better in the periphery of the
city, whereas transport times exhibit more of a systematic discrepancy between
the east (fast) and west (slow) portions of the city. In Paris, in contrast,
faster transport times and better bicycle infrastructure are both concentrated
more towards the centre of the city.</p>
<p>Relationships between transport times and the index of accessibility to natural
spaces are also very strong, and negative. This means that faster transport
times are associated with lower accessibility to natural spaces, as might be
generally expected of most high-density cities. The relationship is stronger in
Berlin than Paris, indicating that faster transport times are most strongly
associated with poorer access to natural spaces there than in Paris.</p>
<p>Finally, absolute transport times are slightly negatively associated with
numbers of automobile parking spaces in Paris, whereas there is no relationship
in Berlin. This negative relationship indicates that regions with faster public
transport also tend to have more automobile parking spaces, reflecting planning
decisions that associate use of public transport with the driving of private
automobiles. No such relationship appears to exist in Berlin.</p>
<h3 id="non-transport-variables"><a class="header" href="#non-transport-variables">Non-Transport Variables</a></h3>
<p>Shorter school distances are positively associated with the bicycle index in
Paris, indicating a positive association between good bicycle infrastructure
and short distances to schools. Berlin manifests no such relationship, likely
for reasons described above, that bicycle infrastructure in Berlin is generally
more peripheral than in Paris.</p>
<p>Although much weaker, relationships between schools distances and the index of
accessibility to natural spaces are negative, indicating that locations closer
to schools are further from nature, and more so in Berlin than in Paris.</p>
<p>Finally, the social variables are more strongly related to all other
non-transport variables in Paris than in Berlin, except for with the index of
bicycle infrastructure. This variable is more strongly, and positively,
correlated with the social indicator in Berlin than in Paris, where the
relationship is negative. The positive relationship in Berlin indicates that
the provision of bicycle infrastructure is positively associated with social
advantage, an effect again readily seen in examining the map of Berlin. In
contrast, Paris is more effective in providing bicycle infrastructure in areas
of relative social disadvantage.</p>
<p>Paris also seems to be more effective in educational provision in areas of
social disadvantage, with the strong negative correlation indicating that
socially disadvantaged Parisians generally have to travel shorter distances to
schools. Although this relationship is also negative in Berlin, it is much
weaker.</p>
<p>In contrast, Paris's very strong and positive relationship between social
advantage and access to natural spaces indicates the relatively far greater
difficulty experienced by less socially advantaged Parisians in accessing
natural spaces compared with equivalent inhabitants of Berlin.</p>
<p>Finally, Paris manifests a very strong and negative association between social
advantage and numbers of automobile parking spaces, indicating that low social
disadvantage is strongly associated with high numbers of automobile parking
spaces, or conversely that socially disadvantaged parts of the city offer
relatively few automobile parking spaces. The relationship in Berlin is, in
contrast, slightly positive.</p>
<h2 id="conclusions"><a class="header" href="#conclusions">Conclusions</a></h2>
<h3 id="lessons-for-berlin"><a class="header" href="#lessons-for-berlin">Lessons for Berlin</a></h3>
<p>Paris's transport system is considerably faster and more frequent.
Nevertheless, it also involves greater numbers of transfers, suggesting that
any attempt to improve the system in Berlin should take care to avoid
inadvertently increasing numbers of transfers.</p>
<p>Berlin's average relative speed is also notably higher than Paris's, and at
1.09 likely too high to effectively discourage large numbers of people from
opting to travel via private automobile. Examination of the map of relative
travel times clearly reveals the effect of the connected ring out autobahns
encircling the city. While reducing speeds on these carriageways may not be
feasible, a uniform 30km/hour limit as introduced in Paris may nevertheless
significantly reduce this ratio, and further incentivise many more people to
opt for public transport rather than private automobile.</p>
<p>Although Paris is a far larger city, its average population density is
nevertheless very similar to Berlin's. It is then even more striking that Paris
offers considerably shorter average distances to schools than Berlin. School
distances in Berlin are also only weakly correlated with social conditions,
whereas average distances to schools in Paris are shorter in less socially
advantaged areas. Both of these factors indicate a need in Berlin for more
provision of local schooling in general, and particularly in socially
disadvantaged regions, if it is to match the educational opportunities provided
in Paris.</p>
<p>Paris's bicycle infrastructure is considerably better than Berlin's, and
perhaps even more importantly, becomes better towards the inner city regions.
In contrast, Berlin really only offers good bicycle infrastructure in the
relatively peripheral, and more affluent, outer regions. Berlin really needs to
proactively focus on improving bicycle infrastructure in the inner city
regions.</p>
<p>Berlin is fortunately greatly enhanced by an abundance of natural space,
including access to the city's rivers and canals, and access to these natural
spaces is only weakly related to social advantage. This provides robust
evidence for Berlin to appreciate its natural spaces, and to ensure that they
remain accessible for everybody.</p>
<h3 id="lessons-for-paris"><a class="header" href="#lessons-for-paris">Lessons for Paris</a></h3>
<p>Paris's transport system is notably better than Berlin's in almost all ways
except for the number of transfers necessary to travel equivalent distances.
This difference is especially notable given that Paris is much larger than
Berlin. Improvements to Paris's public transport system should focus on
decreasing numbers of transfers.</p>
<p>Paris's average relative speed is very close to the "magical" value of one, at
which point private automobiles are no faster than multi-modal transport
including walking and cycling.</p>
<p>Paris has done a great job of providing bicycle infrastructure in the inner
city regions, and notably of proactively enhancing or creating bicycle
infrastructure in regions of social disadvantage.</p>
<p>Contrasts with Berlin nevertheless emphasise a couple of aspects which Paris
could focus on improving. The most notable of these is the index of
accessibility to natural spaces, and the relationship of this to other
variables. Paris simply has far less natural space than Berlin, and much poorer
general accessibility. Moreover, access to natural spaces is positively
associated with social advantage, so that it is relatively difficult for
socially disadvantaged Parisians to access natural spaces.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="variables"><a class="header" href="#variables">Variables</a></h1>
<p>All UA variables are measured such that lower or negative values are good,
whereas higher values are bad. (Exceptions are neutral variables such as
population density which are nevertheless straightforward to interpret.) For
example, unemployment or transport times are both better when values are lower.
Indices of bicycle infrastructure and access to natural spaces are also
transformed so that lower values indicate better or more of either. In these
cases, the transformations are simply one minus the respective proportions of
journeys out to a fixed distance travelled along bicycle infrastructure, or
through or alongside natural spaces. Values of 0 then reflect 100% of all
journeys spent on bicycle infrastructure or in natural spaces, while values of
1 would represent complete absence of either bicycle infrastructure or natural
spaces.</p>
<p>Variables are measured for every way, path, or street intersection within each
city. Values for the maps are aggregated within polygons defined by the
<em>Socio-demographic variables</em> described in the following sub-section, while
values within the statistics page are aggregated across entire cities. Unless
explicitly described otherwise, values of all variables are weighted by
population density. This means that, for example, distances to nearest schools
represent average distances that each person must travel to get to school. Full
descriptions of the calculation of all variables are given in the <a href="./software.html"><em>Software
and Algorithms</em> chapter</a>.</p>
<h2 id="socio-demographic-variables"><a class="header" href="#socio-demographic-variables">Socio-demographic variables</a></h2>
<p>The extent and structure of each city is defined by its "socio-demographic
variable," or "social variable" for short. These are taken from open-source
datasets provided by the cities as a series of geographic areas, defined as
polygonal shapes, and some corresponding measure of socio-demographic
disadvantage. The cities themselves decide the resolution and extent of these
polygonal data. These polygons then define the extent and shape of cities
analysed in Urban Analyst, and the individual polygons into which the map data
are aggregated.</p>
<p>Values of these socio-demographic variables are the only aspect that differs
between different cities. One of the simplest versions is unemployment rate,
generally measured either as a percentage (0-100), or a proportion (0-1). The
UA platform selects the most representative measure of general social
disadvantage provided by each city, and defaults to rates of unemployment only
where no more comprehensive of integrative measures are openly provided by
cities.</p>
<h2 id="travel-variables"><a class="header" href="#travel-variables">Travel Variables</a></h2>
<p>Urban Analyst provides highly detailed statistics on transport systems. Many of
these are derived from estimates of times required to travel fixed distances of
10km. This value is chosen to capture the general efficiency of public
transport systems. Shorter distances do not sufficiently capture the influence
of transport modes such as express or long-distance train services, while
longer distances unfairly penalise smaller cities in which most journeys are
only of shorter distances.</p>
<p>Values at this distance of 10km are obtained by following these three steps,
taking the example statistic of travel times:</p>
<ol>
<li>Calculate total travel times from all street intersections to all other
street intersections within a city.</li>
<li>Calculate a straight line of "best fit" (a "least squares regression" line)
which describes how travel times vary with distance.</li>
<li>Use that line to obtain the "average" value of travel time at the distance
of 10km.</li>
</ol>
<p>Values shown in the maps are aggregated within each polygon of a chosen city,
while values shown in the statistics page are aggregated over entire cities.</p>
<p>The remainder of this section describes the five travel variables:</p>
<ul>
<li>Absolute travel times</li>
<li>Relative travel times</li>
<li>Numbers of transfers</li>
<li>Intervals between consecutive services</li>
<li>Compound travel statistic</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="absolute-and-relative-travel-times"><a class="header" href="#absolute-and-relative-travel-times">Absolute and Relative Travel Times</a></h3>
<p>Urban Analyst enables comparisons of travel times between two primary modes of
transport:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Private Automobile.</em> Travel times with private automobile are used as a
benchmark for measures of travel time using other modes. UA generates
realistic estimates of private automobile travel times through scaling to
empirically observed data on actual vehicular travel times. (Calibration
procedures are implemented and documented in <a href="https://github.com/UrbanAnalyst/ttcalib">this GitHub
repository</a>.) Importantly, UA
includes an additional, unique aspect of automobile travel times not
quantified in any other equivalent system, through an algorithm to accurately
estimate the likely time required to park a private vehicle, and then to walk
to a desired destination. These parking times are crucial, as direct travel
times to many inner-city destinations do not provide realistic estimates of
actual journey times to locations where it may be impossible to actually park
a private automobile.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Multi-Modal Transport.</em> UA's "multi-modal travel times" represent fastest
possible times taken for journeys from every single point in a city to travel
10km using any combination of transport modes excluding private automobile.
The primary modes considered are walking, bicycling, and all available modes
of public transport within each city. Where it is faster to cycle 10km than
to take public transport (such as from locations with very poor public
transport connections, or on the top of long hills where downhill cycling may
actually be faster), these times will represent the single mode of cycling
only, but multi-modal times will generally reflect fastest times formed by
combining multiple modes of transport.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Travel times measured these two ways are then combined to generate the
following two primary travel time statistics:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Absolute travel times</em> as the multi-modal travel times; that is, using any
mode except private automobile.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Relative travel times</em> as the ratios of absolute travel times compared with
equivalent travel times with private automobile. Relative travel times of
less than one indicate that multi-modal transport is faster than equivalent
transport with private automobile, while values greater than one indicate
that private automobile transport is faster.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="intervals-and-numbers-of-transfers"><a class="header" href="#intervals-and-numbers-of-transfers">Intervals and Numbers of Transfers</a></h3>
<p>In addition to travel times, UA also includes the following two additional
statistics quantifying other aspects of public transport systems. Both are
measured for every point of origin with a city, with final values again derived
by following the steps described above to obtain average values of each for all
trips of 10km distance. Numbers of transfers are thus the average number
required for all journeys of 10km, while intervals are the required waiting
times for the next equivalent journey out to that distance.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Intervals to Next Service</em> are measured in minutes. For each point of origin
in a city, this statistic measures the waiting time necessary before
departing to each destination within a city on the service after the one
corresponding to the fastest journey. This delayed service may not be fast as
the original, or it may even be faster in some cases, as the UA algorithms
also prioritise connections with the fewest possible transfers. It can happen
that subsequent services are actually faster, yet involve additional
transfers not required in the originally identified "fastest" service.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Numbers of Transfers</em> measure the number of transfers necessary for a
<em>minimal-transfer</em> journey out to a distance of 10km. These
<em>minimal-transfer</em> journeys are selected to allow for journeys slightly
slower than absolute fastest journeys (generally by up to 5 minutes) if they
involve fewer transfers.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-compound-travel-statistic"><a class="header" href="#the-compound-travel-statistic">The Compound Travel Statistic</a></h3>
<p>All three of the statistics described above - travel times, intervals, and
numbers of transfers - are measured such that lower values are more desirable.
Travel times are then directly multiplied by (a logarithmically-transformed
version of) intervals between services to generate a "<em>compound travel
statistic</em>". Low values of this statistic only arise in locations which have
fast travel times and short intervals between services. Low values may
accordingly always be interpreted as indicating overall good transport
services. In contrast, high values may arise through various combinations of
variables, from extremely high values of one single variable, to less extreme
combinations of the two variables. It is thus generally not possible to
directly discern reasons for high values of this compound travel statistic.
Urban Analyst nevertheless provides direct insight into all individual values,
as well as all pairwise combinations of values, permitting indirect insight.</p>
<h2 id="population-density"><a class="header" href="#population-density">Population density</a></h2>
<p>Population density values are taken directly from the <a href="https://ghsl.jrc.ec.europa.eu/index.php">European Union <em>Global
Human Settlement Layer</em></a> data,
aggregated into polygons for maps, or across entire cities for statistics.</p>
<h2 id="distance-to-nearest-schools"><a class="header" href="#distance-to-nearest-schools">Distance to nearest schools</a></h2>
<p>Distances to nearest schools are measured in kilometres, as shortest walking
distances from each point to the nearest school. These are network distances,
and not simple straight line distances. A single value is ascribed to each
point within a city, and all points aggregated after weighting by local
population densities.</p>
<h2 id="bicycle-infrastructure"><a class="header" href="#bicycle-infrastructure">Bicycle infrastructure</a></h2>
<p>The bicycle infrastructure index is derived from a measure of the proportion of
all possible journeys from each point out to a fixed distance of five
kilometres that travel along dedicated bicycle infrastructure. To conform with
all other UA variables, the index is one minus this proportion, so that low
values reflect high proportions of bicycle infrastructure. Values of zero would
then reflect all journeys taken along dedicated bicycle paths, while values of
one would mean a complete absence of dedicated bicycle infrastructure.</p>
<p>Travel is calculated using a bicycle-specific algorithm that only extends along
ways unsuitable for bicycle travel where no alternatives exist. The weighting
scheme used adds total distances for all portions of travel along designated
cycleways that are separated from vehicular traffic. Portions of trips
extending along other types of ways are added with "half weightings" so, for
example, one kilometre along these types is equivalent to two kilometres on
dedicated bicycle ways. These "half-weight" ways include residential or
"living" streets, unpaved tracks, and bicycle lanes directly alongside
automobile lanes. A third category of ways are weighted at one-quarter,
including footpaths and general pedestrian areas which permit bicycle travel.
The precise weighting scheme can be viewed in <a href="https://github.com/UrbanAnalyst/uaengine/blob/main/R/bicycle-infrastructure.R">this source code
file</a>.</p>
<p>The weighted sums of all distances along these types of ways traversed out to
five kilometres from any given point are then divided by the sum of all
distances travelled regardless of way type to give a ratio between zero and
one. This bicycle infrastructure index is then one minus this value.</p>
<h2 id="natural-space-accessibility"><a class="header" href="#natural-space-accessibility">Natural space accessibility</a></h2>
<p>Natural space accessibility is measured in a similar way to the bicycle
infrastructure variable, except it quantifies proportions of walking distances
out to maximal distances of two kilometres that traverse natural spaces. This
provides a more realistic measure of natural space than simple aggregations of
areas, because it measures the ability of people to directly walk from every
point in a city through or alongside nearby natural spaces.</p>
<p>Moreover, aggregate metrics do not generally capture the ability of people to
actually access natural spaces. A park may, for example, have restricted or
even private access. This would count as a natural space in a simply aggregate
metric, yet not in UA because access restrictions are taken into account in the
routing algorithms.</p>
<p>The algorithm also measures lengths of ways walked adjacent to water -
so-called "blue space", providing a comprehensive metric of the actual ability
to access natural spaces from every point in a city. A natural space index of
zero would represent an entire city of natural space, with no built structures
at all, while a value of one would represent a complete absence of natural
spaces.</p>
<h2 id="parking-index"><a class="header" href="#parking-index">Parking index</a></h2>
<p>The parking index is the ratio of numbers of nearby parking spaces to total
volumes of nearby buildings. The parking statistic is calculated for each point
by adding all nearby parking spaces with a weighting scheme that decreases
exponentially with distance, so that nearby parking spaces count more than
parking spaces that are farther away. Building volumes are also aggregated
using an identical weighting scheme. The parking index at each point is then
the ratio of the sum of distance-weighted numbers of parking spaces to the sum
of distance-weighted total building volumes.</p>
<p>All publicly accessible parking spaces are counted, including on-street
parking, open parking lots, and multi-level parking garages. Building volumes
are aggregated regardless of type or purpose.</p>
<h2 id="housing-value-and-rent"><a class="header" href="#housing-value-and-rent">Housing value and rent</a></h2>
<p>For USA cities only, additional statistics are provided for average housing
value per room, and average rental per room, both in US dollars.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="data-sources"><a class="header" href="#data-sources">Data Sources</a></h1>
<p>The Urban Analyst platform aims to be applicable to as much of the world as
possible. To achieve this, data sources are chosen which are ideally have
global coverage, and which are not specific to any one city. The global sources used are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://openstreetmap.org">Open Street Map</a> for all data on traversable
ways, natural spaces, parking infrastructure, and locations of schools.</li>
<li>Population density data from the <a href="https://ghsl.jrc.ec.europa.eu/index.php">European Union <em>Global Human Settlement
Layer</em></a>.</li>
<li>Elevation data from <a href="https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/">NASA Earth Observation
Data</a>, used to include effects of incline
on both pedestrian and bicycle travel times.</li>
</ul>
<p>The following additional data are then required for each city:</p>
<ul>
<li>Data on some measure of socio-demographic inequality or disadvantage, such as
rates of unemployment, quantified within a series of polygonal shapes which
are also used to define each city.</li>
<li>Data on public transport timetables in <em>General Transit Feed Specification</em>
(GTFS) format, or in other formats able to be converted to GTFS format.</li>
</ul>
<p>The last of these data requirements is the most restrictive, as most cities of
the world do not have or provide public transport data in GTFS format. There
are nevertheless thousands of cities which do provide GTFS feeds, as can be
seen for example in the GTFS feed aggregation platform
<a href="https://transit.land">transit.land</a>.</p>
<p>For USA cities, data for the additional two variables of housing value and
rental price per room are obtained from US Government census data.</p>
